# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add basic error handling to prevent worker crashes
  - Wrap all operations in try-catch blocks that return error responses instead of raising exceptions
  - Add GPU memory cleanup after each image generation using torch.cuda.empty_cache()
  - Implement basic logging to capture error details for debugging
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 3.1_

- [x] 2. Fix initialization error handling
  - Add proper exception handling in initialize_worker() that doesn't crash the process
  - Return structured error responses when initialization fails
  - Add memory availability check before loading the FLUX model
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5_

- [x] 3. Add request validation and input sanitization
  - Validate required fields (prompt, user_id) before processing
  - Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal issues
  - Add basic prompt length limits to prevent memory issues
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 4. Test the minimal fixes with your existing prompt
  - Deploy the updated handler with basic error handling
  - Test with the same prompt that was causing crashes
  - Verify worker stays alive and returns proper error responses
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_
