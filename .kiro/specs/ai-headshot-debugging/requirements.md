# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on debugging and improving the AI headshot generation service that currently experiences worker crashes on Runpod with exit codes 1 and 15. The service should reliably generate professional headshots from text prompts, upload them to Supabase storage, and return signed URLs to users. The system needs robust error handling, proper resource management, and reliable initialization to prevent worker crashes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to submit a headshot generation request with a prompt and receive a generated image URL, so that I can get AI-generated professional headshots reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a valid prompt and user_id THEN the system SHALL generate a professional headshot image
2. WHEN image generation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL upload the image to Supabase storage under the user's directory
3. WHEN the upload completes THEN the system SHALL return a signed URL valid for at least 1 hour
4. WHEN any step fails THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error message without crashing the worker

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the worker to initialize properly and handle resource constraints gracefully, so that the service remains stable under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the worker starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables before proceeding
2. WHEN CUDA is not available THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message without crashing
3. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and graceful degradation
4. WHEN memory is insufficient THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without worker exit
5. WHEN initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the service, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any exception occurs THEN the system SHALL log the full traceback with context information
2. WHEN worker initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log specific failure reasons and environment state
3. WHEN image generation fails THEN the system SHALL capture and log model-specific error details
4. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL log S3/Supabase connection and authentication details
5. WHEN the system encounters resource limits THEN the system SHALL log memory and GPU usage information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a service operator, I want the worker to handle concurrent requests efficiently without memory leaks or resource exhaustion, so that the service can scale reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple requests are processed THEN the system SHALL properly clean up GPU memory after each generation
2. WHEN the worker processes requests continuously THEN the system SHALL not accumulate memory leaks
3. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL implement proper backpressure mechanisms
4. WHEN the model pipeline is reused THEN the system SHALL ensure thread safety and proper state management

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want input validation and sanitization for my requests, so that invalid inputs don't cause system crashes or security issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request lacks required fields THEN the system SHALL return a validation error without processing
2. WHEN prompt text contains potentially harmful content THEN the system SHALL sanitize or reject the input
3. WHEN user_id format is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize the identifier
4. WHEN request payload is malformed THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses
5. WHEN file paths are constructed THEN the system SHALL prevent directory traversal attacks
